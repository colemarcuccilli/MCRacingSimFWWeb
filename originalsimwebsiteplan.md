Strategic Digital Architecture & Commercial Launch Plan: MC Racing Sim Fort Wayne
1. Executive Strategy & Market Positioning
The Venue: MC Racing Sim Fort Wayne

Location: 1205 W Main St, Fort Wayne, IN 46808

The Core Challenge: Translating the high-volume, "frictionless fun" website model of Sky Zone (a multi-national franchise) into a high-performance, single-location boutique operating out of an 8,000+ sq ft industrial warehouse.

Where Sky Zone sells "gravity-defying" play to the masses, MC Racing Sim sells "precision and immersion" to a niche audience. The website must mimic Sky Zone’s conversion psychology—using urgency, clear packaging, and sensory language—but strip away the corporate bloat. The user isn't "finding a park"; they are entering "The Paddock."

The facility's physical location (a 1940s vintage warehouse with 14-foot ceilings) supports a gritty, "underground racing" aesthetic. The website will leverage this "Industrial Chic" vibe to frame the venue not as a family entertainment center, but as a factory of speed.

2. Visual Identity & "Word Usage" Translation
Sky Zone’s styling is rounded, orange, and "bouncy." MC Racing Sim’s styling must be sharp, dark, and "fast." We will reverse-engineer Sky Zone's vocabulary and visual hierarchy to suit the $15,000 simulator hardware without stating the price.

2.1 The Translation Matrix (Word Usage)
Sky Zone uses verbs that imply freedom (Fly, Soar, Bounce). We will use verbs that imply control (Apex, Drift, Fight).

Sky Zone Term 

MC Racing Sim Equivalent	Psychological Trigger
"Jump / Fly"	"Drive / Dive / Send It"	Shifts focus from vertical freedom to horizontal speed and bravery.
"Attractions"	" The Grid / The Dirt"	"Attractions" sounds like a carnival; "The Grid" sounds like a competition venue.
"Party Host"	"Race Director"	Elevates the staff member from a babysitter to an authority figure in the pit lane.
"Waiver"	"Tech Inspection"	Rebrands a boring legal requirement as part of the pre-race vehicle check.
"Socks"	"Gloves / Shoes"	Sky Zone sells grip socks; we sell the idea of "driver readiness" (bring your own or rent).
"Find Your Park"	"Locate the Paddock"	Contextualizes the specific warehouse location.
  
2.2 Visual Style Guide
Color Palette:

Asphalt Black (#1A1A1A): The primary background color. Reduces eye strain and makes the screen content pop (crucial for sim visuals).

Apex Red (#E62322): The "Call to Action" color (Book Now, Race). High urgency.

Telemetry Cyan (#00AEEF): Used for data points (pricing, lap times). Implies technology and precision.

Typography:

Headlines: Italicized Sans-Serif (Uppercase). Slanted text implies forward motion/speed (e.g., RACING SANS).

Body Copy: Monospace (Typewriter style). Mimics telemetry data or coding, reinforcing the "Simulator" tech aspect.

3. Site Map & Wireframe Strategy
Since this is a single location, the "Global Portal" is replaced by a "Direct Action" homepage.

Page 1: The Homepage (The Start Line)
Goal: Explain the "Sim + RC" concept and anchor the price immediately.

Hero Section:

Background: Video loop of the 3 simulators in motion (heaving, pitching) cut with RC cars launching off a dirt jump.

Headline: "REAL PHYSICS. NO CONSEQUENCES."

Sub-head: "Fort Wayne’s only professional-grade Sim Racing & RC Lounge. Located at 1205 W Main St."

Primary CTA Button: **** (Anchors to Booking Engine).

The "Hardware" Tease (The Simulators):

Visual: Close up of the direct-drive wheel and hydraulic pedals.

Copy: "This isn't an arcade game. It's training hardware. Feel every bump, curb, and loss of traction on ultra-realistic rigs used by pro drivers." (Avoids saying "$15k" but implies it heavily).

The "Short Course" Tease (RC Track):

Visual: Low-angle shot of an RC truck kicking up dust/dirt.

Copy: "Technical short-course RC racing. Jumps, rhythm sections, and head-to-head battles."

Page 2: The Garage (Pricing & Simulator Booking)
Goal: Manage the 3-Sim constraint using "Group" psychology.

The Pricing Table: Sky Zone uses "Elite/Basic" tiers. We will use "Session Durations" tiers.

Class	Duration	Price (Solo)	Team Entry (Group of 3)	Value Logic
Sprint	1 Hour	$65	$170 ($57/driver)	The "Anchor." Push the group rate to fill all 3 seats.
Grand Prix	2 Hours	$120	$330 ($110/driver)	Better value for serious practice.
Endurance	3 Hours	$170	$450 ($150/driver)	Best value. Keeps the sims booked all night.
The "Grid Logic" (Booking Engine Rule):

User Note: "We only have 3 spots on the grid."

Scarcity Tactic: "Only 1 seat left for the 7:00 PM Sprint!" (This drives urgency).

Page 3: The Pit Lane (Parties & Events)
Goal: Sell the $500 Birthday Package using Sky Zone’s "Hassle-Free" pitch.

Headline: "THE ULTIMATE BIRTHDAY GRAND PRIX."

The Pitch: "Epic for them. Effortless for you. You bring the crew (up to 10 racers), we provide the track, the cars, and the Race Director."

The Package ($500 / 3 Hours):

Rotation System: Explicitly explain how 10 kids use 3 sims. "The Grid Rotation: While 3 drivers race in the sims, the rest of the crew competes on the RC Track or fuels up in the lounge. Non-stop action, zero downtime."

Inclusions: "Race Director (Host)," "Podium Ceremony," "Digital Race Results."

Corporate: "Team Building at 200 MPH. Settle the office rivalry on the track."

Page 4: The Location (1205 W Main St)
Goal: Romanticize the Warehouse.

Visual: Wide shot of the high ceilings and open warehouse space. Dark lighting with neon accents on the rigs.

Copy: "Housed in a historic industrial warehouse in the heart of Fort Wayne, MC Racing Sim is an underground car culture haven. High ceilings, raw concrete, and the smell of ozone."

Map Integration: "West Main Street / Nebraska Neighborhood."

4. Operational "Word Usage" for Rules
Sky Zone has strict rules (One person per trampoline). We need strict rules to protect the $15k equipment.

"No Shoes on the Sim" -> "Driving Shoes or Socks Required in the Cockpit." (Frames it as a pro requirement, not a hygiene one).

"Don't touch the screens" -> "Hands on the Wheel. Eyes on the Apex."

"Waiver Required" -> "Tech Inspection Mandatory." (Waiver must cover motion sickness and equipment damage liability).

5. Summary of Deliverables
Photography Plan: We need dark, moody shots of the glowing rigs against the warehouse brick/concrete, and high-shutter-speed shots of the RC cars.

Booking Backend: Needs to be set up so that a "Group of 3" booking instantly blocks off 3 "Individual" slots for that time block.

Waiver Integration: Must be digital and signed before arrival to prevent bottlenecks at the door.
